Pickle is one of the standard library modules in Python used for serializing (converting objects to byte streams) and deserializing (converting byte streams back to objects) data.
It allows you to save Python objects to or load them from a file, in order to share data between different Python programs or at different points in time."""
"""
`TensorFlow. Keras ` is an advanced deep learning API in the TensorFlow deep learning framework used for constructing, training, and deploying neural network models. It is the default advanced API introduced in TensorFlow 2.0 version.
Keras is an open-source neural network library used for quickly building deep learning models, while 'tensorflow. keras' is an interface that integrates Keras into TensorFlow. Through 'tensorflow. keras', 
you can use Keras to provide a concise and user-friendly advanced API to define and train neural network models.
`TensorFlow. Keras provides a series of tools such as layers, loss functions, optimizers, metrics, etc., making building and training deep learning models simpler and more efficient. It also supports seamless integration with other modules of TensorFlow, making it easy to use TensorFlow's features such as tensor operations, multi GPU training, and more.
In summary, 'tensorflow. Keras' is a part of TensorFlow that integrates Keras and provides a powerful advanced API, making building and training deep learning models more convenient and flexible.
